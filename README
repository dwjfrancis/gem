Readme for the colorizr ruby gem for the Beginers Ruby course at Udacity

Colorizr is a ruby gem to let you add color to a string while doing a puts, print or pp 
in Ruby code.  It is a simple gem that will take a string using the method call for the 
desired color return the string in that color for the use of terminal output.

To use the colorizr gem you should have the code in the gem/lib directory with the 
colorizr.rb file included in it.  You would also need the colorizr.gemspec file in the gem directory (this can be renamed as long as the lib directory is not changed).
You will have to build and install this gem using the ommands:
gem build colorizr.gemspec
gem install colorizr-0.0.2.gem

And the insure you add "require 'colorizr'"
in the calling code.

Lastly insure you build the color methods by calling 
String.create_colors

this will allow you to send the string to the terminal in color by:

astring = "This will be in color"
puts astring.red

for the colors:
red, green, yellow, blue, pink, light_blue, white, light_gray, black

In case it is needed there are two other methods:

colors
and 
sample_colors

that will show the colors this gem is equipped to let you use. If you need more colors
look up the color and value, add them to the hashand rebuild the gem.

Have fun!
